# Shared Content Across Issues

The following content is provided in every issue of FotW, serving as a lind of prelude for each issue.

## Goals

The goals of FotW are centered around practical education to give more attention to tools that are often underappreciated, ignored, or never make their way to radical circles because of the knowledge silo of Tech Industry. It is not the goal of FotW to "teach you to code," get you a tech job, or even to teach you everything there is to know about computers (a daunting task even for the most experienced technologist).

References to places where these writings can be found online are proliferated throughout the issues.

To utilize anarchoautonomist methods to educate motivated individuals and save them the hours they would otherwise spend searching alone.

To make more accessible high-quality information and comprehensive guides on building autonomous digital infrastructure, so that radicals in particular can stop confusing autonomy with proprietary services, like SquareSpace or Google Groups.

IN SO DOING,

To break apart technophobia by empowering the ones who thought they could never be empowered due to trauma inflicted by abusive tech scenes or advanced by fear mongers who don't actually know what computers are.

To speak directly to the experience of being a marginalized person who do not feel welcome in most "Tech Spaces."

To undermine the idea that the meme war is the most pertinent digital battle by giving motivated radical communities more powerful tools.

To give governments something to fear about which they can do nothing.

## Ethos


## Sanity Check

0. Redefining digital technologies ("Preface")

1. Common mistakes in radical circles
    - Listen to those who know more, when they treat you fairly, but also learn how to distinguish between who knows more than someone else.
    - Most people who say they know things don't know anything important. This tends to be especially true if the person talks down to you. Fuck those people, they don't know shit and if you read FotW, you'll be able to run circles around them instantly.
    - In most cases, when comparing virtually equivalent tools, the specific tool does not matter: all digital tools are built on the same foundations, and it is vastly more important to grasp those foundations. Radicals will spent countless hours arguing which is better. We hope these guides will lay those stupid pointless arguments to rest.
    - Learning to code is usually the last thing you need to know. There are millions of skilled programmers out there who have already poured blood sweat and tears into their work, for you to use them. *So use them!*
    - You will no doubt encounter the hyperparanoid person who argues Signal is not safe because you're using a phone that has connections to Google. While this is not entirely baseless, *it is largely completely irrelevant to your work,* even when you are doing illegal actions. Learn how to properly threat model at the beginning of this book. For the more state actor threat levels, refer to the specific FotW volume either in print or online regarding this level of security.
