# Fire on the Wire, Volume 3: Collectivization

Volume 1 of Fire on the Wire, *Collectivization*, is all about how to expand and scale autonomous infrastructures into networks and multiplicities.

* How and when expand self-hosted systems, including both systems that were introduced and explored in the first stages of self-hosting, and expanding to networking infrastructures such as intranets, extranets, and mesh networking.
* Necessary Skill Level: High (advanced)
* General ideas:
    * Assessing the needs for and regarding the expansion of various self-hosted infrastructures based on the successes and habits developed from using those self-hosted infrastructures in the context of the organization (eg. when and how does one organization need to grow to fuse into another? How can education spread from one organization to the next? Or, more internally, how can/should one system talk to another? How does an org judge this and then implement this depending on those judgments?) 
    * More advanced system administration
    * Larger scale automation
    * Handling hardware questions
    * Introductions to more advanced security questions regarding:
          * Encrypted disks
          * Network security
