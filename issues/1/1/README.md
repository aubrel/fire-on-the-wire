# Liberation: Issue 1

In this issue, we will go on a crash course tour of digital tools most radicals don't talk about, and how (and why) to use them. Liberation focuses on introducing easy-to-use tools that require little to no deep skill or familiarity with which to get started that nonetheless provide powerful infrastructural organizing capacity to individuals and groups.

# Introduction

A fact that often gets ignored is that there are a lot of talented developers out there with their hearts and work in the right places, who have poured blood, sweat, tears, and time into making great tools for other like-minded people. In the case of basic organizational and communications tools, the challenge far from creating new tools: there are thousands to choose from that have existed for decades. The challenge then lies in understanding the fundamentals of what the tool does, and to not become seduced by pedantic arguments that split hairs between one over the other. Never let endless rhetoric distract or intimidate you from just picking up and trying out tools.

At the very least, pick up the following and give them a shot; we'll provide you with some reasons why we like the following, and you are welcome to make your own judgments when you try more stuff.

# Messaging

> :construction: TK-TODO

When we talk about messaging, there are a few things we should clarify. When we say "messaging," what we actually mean is a form of communication that is:

* Immediate: à la text messaging

* Direct/Synchronous: Regardless of whether the message is going to a group or an individual, when we talk about messaging in this way, we mean a message that is sent directly to an individual or person, as opposed to being put somewhere that the person has to take action to find. (Think of a text message versus a forum, or someone saying your name to get your attention, rather than leaving a note for you somewhere.) The latter is a different kind of communication — asynchronous communication — which is a different and crucial aspect of organizing, which we will explore later.

* Ad-hoc: Messaging services in the way we mean them refers to something that is "ad-hoc," meaning on the fly and for a specific purpose that arises at the moment. Because of this, it is more conversational than infrastructural, and this is a key distinction that we will talk about a lot in this series.

in the context of radical organizing, there are a few concerns that come up time and time again that need to be taken into consideration when choosing messaging tools. Some of these considerations are:

* Security: This is of course the first issue that arises in the context of radical organizing. How safe is it for you to use the tool you've chosen? How easy would it be for someone to compromise? What is your threat model and how does your tool fit into that model? How easy would it be for someone to misuse the tool? What does the worst case scenario look like in the case of compromise if using this tool? And so on and so forth. When it comes to these questions, there are a few measurable aspects that we can look at.

    * Encryption: This comes up a lot when discussing any kind of digital tool. Is the transmission and content of the message encrypted? What does this mean?

    * Authentication: Where encryption is about securing the content and method of transportation, authentication is about securing the _source_ of the transmission. How do you know the source was not tampered with, changed, or intercepted on its way to you? How can you be sure that the person you think you're talking to is who they say they are?

* Ease of use:

* Storage:

## Using Signal…effectively

If you're anywhere near radical circles, you've almost definitely heard about [Signal Private Messenger](https://signal.org), and are maybe already using it. If you felt comfortable enough to ask the person who told you to download an app you've never heard of and use it exclusively for messaging why you would do such a thing, you might have heard something along the lines of, "something, something, end-to-end encrypted." Oh, and maybe something about a private... security... number? Or something...?

Let's demystify the world of Signal, explain why it's actually a good idea to use, address some of the common fears about using it, and explain the vital importance of Signal Safety Numbers.
