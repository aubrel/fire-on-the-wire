# Liberation: Issue 1

> :construction: TK-TODO: Change the content below to be more in line with the TOC and meta.

In this issue, we will introduce some free, open source, and easy-to-use digital tools that most radicals don't talk about, as well as how (and why) to use them. Liberation(1) focuses on introducing tools that require little to no deep skill or familiarity with which to get started, which nonetheless provide powerful organizing abilities to both individuals and groups.

# On this mode of thinking

_“When scholars study a thing, they strive to kill it first, if it's alive; then they have the parts and the'be lost the whole, for the link that's missing was the living soul.”_

― Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, _Faust, Part I_

Before any of the following work can be absorbed, the reader must accept the following premises.

1. Here is a practice born from bloody war that nothing can nor will erase.

1. The ones who make you feel stupid don't know what they're talking about.

1. The ones who make you feel weak are afraid of you (and should be).

1. Digital technologies are never really about specific tools. The ones who argue this will always waste your time. 

1. You are already powerful.

# Communication Forms

One of the most important distinctions to be made is the difference between **synchronous** and **asynchronous** communication forms.

## Synchronous communication

When you're talking to someone in person, this is a mode of synchronous communication. We do not normally say one thing to a friend, to have that friend then walk away from us for a few hours and then return and pick up the conversation immediately where it was left off. This may happen occasionally, but it is not how we normally have conversations. Note, too, that even in this special case, when the conversation is returned to, someone needs to remind the other where they left off.

Synchronous communication implies that the sender and receiver are on the same "clock," and that all points in the communications are sequential.

## Using Signal…effectively

  >  :construction: TK-TODO Fit the below into the structure of the above. Address each issue outlined above below.

If you're anywhere near radical circles, you've almost definitely heard about [Signal Private Messenger](https://signal.org), and are maybe already using it. If you felt comfortable enough to ask the person who told you to download an app you've never heard of and use it exclusively for messaging why you would do such a thing, you might have heard something along the lines of, "something, something, end-to-end encrypted." Oh, and maybe something about a private... security... number? Or something...?

Let's demystify the world of Signal, explain why it's actually a good idea to use, address some of the common fears about using it, and explain the vital importance of Signal Safety Numbers.

## Asynchronous communication

With asynchronous communication, all involved are on different clocks. This means that each person can get the same information in the same way, but at different times. Another way to think about this difference is to think about synchronous communication as a web, in which communication transmits from one point to another, and one action is dependent on another prior action.

Whereas asynchronous communication is more like a watering hole. There are no connecting threads, and everyone comes and goes as they please. If there ate changes, those changes are discovered at different times.

One thing that easily differentiates synchronous and asynchronous communications is that synchronous communications are ad-hoc and rarely written down _in a templatized way._

A primary and easy distinction between these two methods is whether or not the communication was _recorded_, usually meaning _written down_. In synchronous methods, one does not necessarily need to write anything down, whereas asynchronous communication depends upon its being written down; otherwise there would be no way to have conversations without being in the same place at the same time, and if you don't do that, it is the view of this book that _you cannot organize meaningfully._ Period. Hence why it is so important to make this distinction right off the bat.

Synchronous communication is of course just as vital. Nothing develops or grows without synchronous communication.

The point here is, you need both forms absolutely. However, especially in radical circles, it's asynchronous communication that is terribly undervalued, and without a fundamental change in that, no meaningful organizing can happen. Another thing that also happens, which we will address shortly, is that whatever asynchronous communication is being done should be _thoroughly detailed_, so that no follow up questions are needed and time does not go by waiting for an opportunity to have synchronous communication.

Sometimes, we meet hybrid forms of communication, such as texting.

Texting is an example of a form of synchronous communication done in an asynchronous medium. It is synchronous as is defined by its sequential manner and ad hoc nature – one response logically follows another – but it is written down, such that anyone may come back to it later to review it.

However, when reflecting on the use of a tool in an organizing context, consider how it would be to a text or chat log as your main body of reference. It would be extremely inefficient, time consuming, and frustrating. If someone had to scroll through hours of text messages just to find one date and time, it would be an infuriating way to go about things. Even if you have decided to have a dedicated chat room or thread in which only date and time information was recorded, you would doom that potentially malleable information to a static form, thereby neglecting the very most important aspect of digital tools: the magic lies not so much in _what_ is written, as much as in _how_ it is written.

Writing, in a digital context, is invaluably flexible. Its main characteristic, which is so often forgotten or never exposed, is how infinitely a single written thing can expand, bend, and shapeshift. If this power of elasticity can be understood and mastered, then tremendous possibilities for self-empowerment become apparent.

Shapeshifting is the business we are in here, and this is the main principle of this entire work.

Now, we will review some tools that deal with synchronous communication, and go over why this book believes they are good ones.
