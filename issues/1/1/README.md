# Liberation: Issue 1

In this issue, we will go on a crash course tour of digital tools most radicals don't talk about, and how (and why) to use them. Liberation focuses on introducing easy-to-use tools that require little to no deep skill or familiarity with which to get started that nonetheless provide powerful infrastructural organizing capacity to individuals and groups.

# Introduction

A fact that often gets ignored is that there are a lot of talented developers out there with their hearts and work in the right places, who have poured blood, sweat, tears, and time into making great tools for other like-minded people. In the case of basic organizational and communications tools, the challenge far from creating new tools: there are thousands to choose from that have existed for decades. The challenge lies in understanding the fundamentals of what the tool does, and to not become seduced by pedantic arguments that split hairs between one over the other. Never let endless rhetoric distract or intimidate you from just picking up and trying out tools. At the very least, pick up the following and give them a shot; we'll provide you with some reasons we like the following.

## Using Signal…effectively

If you're anywhere near radical circles, you've almost definitely heard about [Signal Private Messenger](https://signal.org), and are maybe already using it. If you felt comfortable enough to ask the person who told you to download an app you've never heard of and use it exclusively for messaging why you would do such a thing, you might have heard something along the lines of, "something, something, end-to-end encrypted." Oh, and maybe something about a private... security... number? Or something...?

Let's demystify the world of Signal, explain why it's actually a good idea to use, address some of the common fears about using it, and explain the vital importance of Signal Safety Numbers.
