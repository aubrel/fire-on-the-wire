## Using Signal…effectively

If you're anywhere near radical circles, you've almost definitely heard about [Signal Private Messenger](https://signal.org), and are maybe already using it. If you felt comfortable enough to ask the person who told you to download an app you've never heard of and use it exclusively for messaging why you would do such a thing, you might have heard something along the lines of, "something, something, end-to-end encrypted." Oh, and maybe something about a private... security... number? Or something...?

Let's demystify the world of Signal, explain why it's actually a good idea to use, address some of the common fears about using it, and explain the vital importance of Signal Safety Numbers.
