# Fire on the Wire, Volume 1: Liberation

Volume 1 of Fire on the Wire, *Liberation*, is all about first reconceptualizing what digital tools actually are. Then, equipped with this new way of thinking, how to make yourself and your comrades, friends, and neighbors more independent from centralized, corporate services such as Google and Twitter, replacing them with free and open source services and software.

* General ideas:
    * Reconceptualizing digital technologies as a modality of thinking.
    * Moving away from centralized services to free and open source alternatives (eg. [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org/) versus Google Maps).
    * Intro to the command line
    * Intro to basic but powerful organizational tools
