# Fire on the Wire, Volume 1: Liberation

Volume 1 of Fire on the Wire, *Liberation*, is all about how to make yourself and your comrades, friends, and neighbors more independent from centralized, corporate services such as Google and Twitter, replacing those services with free and open source services and software. The focus of this volume is to generate movements away from centralized services like Google and corporate social media like Facebook, towards free and open source software and decentralization. Little to no technical skill is needed to immediately utilize these tools.

* General ideas:
    * Moving away from centralized services to free and open source alternatives (eg. [OpenStreetMap](https://openstreetmap.org/) versus Google Maps).
    * Intro to the command line
    * Basic organizational tools (eg. Wikis, secure messaging services, calendars, file sharing and storage)
