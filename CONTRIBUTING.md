# Translate

One way you can help is by translating our texts into a language that you know, but that we do not. We prefer translated texts to be separate files, side-by-side with the initial (i.e., in the same folder). Copy the file you are going to translate with an ISO 639 language code in the file extension. As fluent English speakers, our default language is United States English (`en-US`). Files with no language code are thus expected to match that locale.

For example, to translate the [top-most README](README.md) file into Spanish, copy the file like so:

```sh
cp README.md README.es.md
```

The file `README.es.md` should now be edited so that any English in the document is translated into Spanish.
