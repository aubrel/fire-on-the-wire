## Not sure where to contribute?

Try this.

1. Choose which [tier (volume)](issues/README.md#issues) your work or idea fits in with best.

1. Or else, check out the [Addendum issues](issues/addendum). Addendums are like sattelites, and are the most openly free and community driven, where the core tiers serve as a general organizing principle for the main goals of this body of work.

Both the core tiers and Addendums are open to contributions. The only difference is that what is included in the core tiers is selected more thematically.

# Translate

One way you can help is by translating our texts into a language that you know, but that we do not. We prefer translated texts to be separate files, side-by-side with the initial (i.e., in the same folder). Copy the file you are going to translate with an ISO 639 language code in the file extension. As fluent English speakers, our default language is United States English (`en-US`). Files with no language code are thus expected to match that locale.

For example, to translate the [top-most README](README.md) file into Spanish, copy the file like so:

```sh
cp README.md README.es.md
```

The file `README.es.md` should now be edited so that any English in the document is translated into Spanish.
