# Fire on the Wire

**Fire on the Wire (FotW)** is a monthly(-ish) periodcal in the format of serial guides about building autonomous digital infrastructures, as well as offensive and defensive digital tactics, techniques and procedures ("TTPs"). The guides are distilled from the work of several local New York City and national United States anarcho-autonomist groups, including the [Anarcho-Tech NYC Collective](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC), the [Tech Autonomists](https://tech-autonomy.com/), and select [others](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Accomplices-and-allies) who more-or-less share a common liberatory vision. Fire the technocapitalists, wire the future.

# Goals

The goals of FotW are centered around practical education to give more attention to tools that are often underappreciated, ignored, or never make their way to radical circles because of the knowledge silo of Tech Industry. It is *not* the goal of FotW to "teach you to code," get you a tech job, or even to teach you everything there is to know about computers (a daunting task even for the most experienced technologist).

References to places where these writings can be found online are proliferated throughout the issues.

To utilize anarchoautonomist methods to educate motivated individuals and save them the hours they would otherwise spend searching alone.

To make more accessible high-quality information and comprehensive guides on building autonomous digital infrastructure, so that radicals in particular can stop confusing autonomy with proprietary services, like SquareSpace or Google Groups.

**IN SO DOING,**

To break apart technophobia by empowering the ones who thought they could never be empowered due to trauma inflicted by abusive tech scenes or advanced by fear mongers who don't actually know what computers are.

To speak directly to the experience of being a marginalized person who do not feel welcome in most "Tech Spaces."

To undermine the idea that the meme war is the most pertinent digital battle by giving motivated radical communities more powerful tools.

To give governments something to fear about which they can do nothing.

# Overview

## What?

A collection of small zines educating radicals on constructing autonomous digital infrastructure as well as offensive and defensive digital techniques.

## How?

- Print guides from AnarchoTech, Tech Autonomy.
- Write overarching contextualizing texts.

The overarching process and structure taken up by FotW is to handle three primary stages of development, each of which are explored over the course of several issues per topic. The three primary stages of development are:

1. Liberation:
   How to make yourself and your comrades, friends, and neighbors more independent from centralized, corporate services such as Google and social media, replacing those services with free and open source services and software.

1. Autonomization:
  How to ease yourself into building and using self-hosted services so as to create truly autonomous infrastructure.

1. Collectivization:
  How to expand and scale autonomous infrastructures into networks and multiplicities.

This process progresses from starting with the least amount of technical knowledge, which can be implemented immediately, to the sector that requires the most knowledge, which you will get to eventually.

The other issues in this series will be addendum issues tackling other issues relevant to larger goals. Those addendum issues will be:

1. Defense 101
    1. Tor & TorBrowser
    1. Password managers
1. Offense 101
    1. Hack This Site

## Other Content Ideas

- Design, revisited
- "A quiet, niche war"
- There is a war going on between the people who believe design should simplify technological tools to the point where everything is a shiny button that you click without understanding what is happening, and people who believe design should be beautiful while facilitating genuine education. It is sometimes on the surface hard to distinguish between these people and these sides. If it were not already obvious, this book firmly and mercilessly takes the side of the latter.

## Shared Contents

0. Redefining digital technologies (preface)
1. Common mistakes in radical circles
    - Listen to those who know more, when they treat you fairly, but also learn how to distinguish between who knows more than someone else.
    - Most people who say they know things don't know anything important. This tends to be especially true if the person talks down to you. Fuck those people, they don't know shit and if you read FotW, you'll be able to run circles around them instantly.
    - In most cases, when comparing virtually equivalent tools, the specific tool does not matter: all digital tools are built on the same foundations, and it is vastly more important to grasp those foundations. Radicals will spent countless hours arguing which is better. We hope these guides will lay those stupid pointless arguments to rest.
    - Learning to code is usually the last thing you need to know. There are millions of skilled programmers out there who have already poured blood sweat and tears into their work, for you to use them. *So use them!*
    - You will no doubt encounter the hyperparanoid person who argues Signal is not safe because you're using a phone that has connections to Google. While this is not entirely baseless, *it is largely completely irrelevant to your work,* even when you are doing illegal actions. Learn how to properly threat model at the beginning of this book. For the more state actor threat levels, refer to the specific FotW volume either in print or online regarding this level of security.
1. There's No Such Thing as Software: A Manifesto
    - Of course there is a thing that we call software, but my appeal is to allow yourself to dissolve the preconceived notions you may have about software or digital technologies, so as to make room for the idea that computing is thinking objectified, that it is electricity singing sweet fire on the wire, that the whole of nature is a dialogue to connect to you and this can be another of those things, if we disabuse ourselves of the imperialist history.
